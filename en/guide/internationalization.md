# Internationalization

Although the plugin is simple, we believe user experience should be as good as possible. Therefore, we provide internationalization functionality. You can set the `locale` parameter to select the language. The default language is Chinese. If you want to use English, set `locale` to `en`.

```js
Vue.use(hevueImgPreview, {
  locale: 'en'
})
```
